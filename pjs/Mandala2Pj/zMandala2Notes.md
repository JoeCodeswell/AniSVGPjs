## [Aligning the objects in SVG center](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41562911/aligning-the-objects-in-svg-center)

### Added viewBox to Mandala.svg  >> id=mandala-svg ==`viewBox="-150 -150 400 400"`
- Result: kind of centers the stuff in the index.html >> object id="index-obj-mandala"

## kind of works 
1. arms are rotated and 
2. arms have different colored strokes because arm.svg doesn't specify stroke="green"
